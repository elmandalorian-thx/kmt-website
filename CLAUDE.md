## Development Guidelines

1. Always use the Assessments page as the template reference for new pages
2. Ensure all pages have consistent navigation and footer
3. Footer must show all 3 locations
4. Use semantic HTML and accessible markup
5. Mobile-responsive design is required
6. Keep aesthetics/med-spa services de-emphasized throughout

## Git Workflow

**IMPORTANT: Update CLAUDE.md before any commit or git push.**

Before committing changes:
1. Update the "Current Status" section with completed/pending items
2. Update the "Last Updated" date
3. Update file structure if new files were added
4. Document any new patterns or decisions made

This ensures project context is always current for future development sessions.
